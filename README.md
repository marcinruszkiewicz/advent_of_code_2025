# AdventOfCode 2025 solutions

Elixir solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025) puzzles.

You need your own inputs.

## Running the puzzle solvers

Use the mix tasks. They both take the module name as an argument:

- `mix part1 Day200` solves the part one of the given puzzle using the `part1` method
- `mix part2 Day200` solves the part two of the given puzzle using the `part2` method

You can use the `-b` flag to run the benchmarks for the given task, so that you can improve your solution's speed if necessary.
